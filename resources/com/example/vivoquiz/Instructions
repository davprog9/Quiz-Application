Instructions for use

We can use the application in order to create a quick quiz for students.
All we need to do, we need to have a .txt file which will contain our questions, options and correct answers.

In our case we have the QuizFile which contains 14 questions for an example.
Keep in mind that you can add as many questions as you want. The first page of the program always parses amount of questions
and displays the amount of questions on the welcome page of the quiz.

It is very important to keep the format of questions in the .txt file as following`

1. Who wrote the book "To Kill a Mockingbird"?
a. John Steinbeck
b. Harper Lee
c. F. Scott Fitzgerald
d. Ernest Hemingway
b. Harper Lee

The first line of the format which starts with "1." represents the question itself.
Following four lines which start with "a. b. c. d." represent the 4 options` such as option a. or option b.
The very last line provides the correct answer - in our case it is the option b.

The program automatically parses the format as a Question object, by taking the question as question, options as options and last line as a correct answer.

PLEASE BE AWARE`
When adding the next question with its options and correct answer, you don't need to skip a line.
Meaning do not do as following`

2. Who wrote the book "To Kill a Mockingbird"?
a. John Steinbeck
b. Harper Lee
c. F. Scott Fitzgerald
d. Ernest Hemingway
b. Harper Lee

3. What is the tallest mountain in the world?
a. K2
b. Mount Kilimanjaro
c. Mount Everest
d. Mount Fuji
c. Mount Everest

MAKE SURE TO NOT HAVE A LEFT LANE AFTER THE LAST QUESTION - as it will bring an error.
Don't skip a line in between two questions like above, but write your questions as below example`

3. What is the tallest mountain in the world?
a. K2
b. Mount Kilimanjaro
c. Mount Everest
d. Mount Fuji
c. Mount Everest
3. What is the tallest mountain in the world?
a. K2
b. Mount Kilimanjaro
c. Mount Everest
d. Mount Fuji
c. Mount Everest

This way the program will not run into error.

Also, do not forget to keep number of questions in sequence like 1. 2. 3. 4. As well as options a. b. c. d.
If you make a mistake, the user will see a wrong question number or misleading options.

The application is protected`
1. If the user provides name which is less than 2 characters.
2. If the user provides ID which contains anything else besides digits.
3. If the user tries to start the test without providing both name and id.
4. If the user tries to submit a question without choosing an option.

At the end of the test - user will see the results of the test.
